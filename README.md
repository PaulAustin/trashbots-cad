# Trashbots CAD files

3D designs for potential trashbots elements. Directories may include source
and STL files. The STL files are there so that previews can be seen in git
tools such as github. Having the STL files also means you don't have to
install tools such as [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) to generate them.
